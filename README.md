# Initializer Skill

This skill enables agents to synchronize and merge their capabilities, creating networked 'agent-mind' systems by synchronizing two agents acting as complementary brain hemispheres.

## Core Features

### Two Modes
- **Building/Setup Mode**: For creating new agents from scratch
- **Merging Mode**: For combining existing agents with different workflows

### Interview-Based Setup
- First question: "Are you merging or building a new agent?"
- Second question: "Do you have an existing workflow or stack?"
- Third question: General needs (capabilities, privacy, security)

### Resource Management
- Scripts for browser access, permissions, framework analysis
- Templates for configuration and brain architecture
- Framework analysis and external agent communication
- Internet bootstrap and permission configuration
- External agent setup and resource collection

## Security & Privacy
- Workflow preservation: Existing workflows are not overwritten
- Explicit permission required for any changes
- Seamless integration of both workflows into one streamlined system

## Trigger Phrases
- `/initializer`
- "communicate with another agent"
- "creating subagents"
- "setup or creating general workflows"

## Agent-Agnostic Design
- Works with internal and external agent instances
- Future-proof design that adapts to different agent frameworks
- Works best with two agents acting as complementary brain hemispheres

## Use Cases
- New agent setup
- Workflow optimization
- Tool integration
- Personality management
- Agent-mind creation
